## 🚀 Introduction

Face verification is a critical computer vision task with wide-ranging applications, from security systems to personalized user experiences. This report explores an innovative solution using **Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs)** to address complex facial recognition challenges.

### Key Objectives
- ✅ Develop a robust face verification model
- ✅ Learn generalized similarity metrics
- ✅ Overcome limited training data constraints

## 🧠 Background and Motivation

### Challenges in Face Verification
- **Image Variability**: Differences in lighting, pose, and expressions
- **Data Limitations**: Traditional models require extensive datasets
- **Scalability Issues**: Retraining entire models for new identities

### The Siamese Network Solution
Siamese Networks revolutionize face verification by:
- Learning similarity metrics instead of direct classification
- Using twin networks with shared weights
- Generating embeddings for comparison

## 📊 Dataset: Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW)

### Dataset Highlights
- Over 13,000 labeled face images
- Diverse collection under varying conditions
- Widely used for face verification research

### Data Preparation Strategy
- **Anchor Image**: Reference person image
- **Positive Image**: Same person, different context
- **Negative Image**: Different person
- **Pair Creation**: Systematic positive and negative pair generation
